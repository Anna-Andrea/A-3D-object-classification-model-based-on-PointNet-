dataset:  [ModelNet40](https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/)
summary:
Referring to relevant papers on PointNet and PointNet++, we ultimately chose to implement a 3D object classification model based on PointNet++.

Preprocessed the point cloud data, including normalization, sampling, denoising, and other operations, for input into the PointNet++model.

Attempted various approaches such as farthest point sampling, data augmentation, adding dropout, and hyperparameter optimization, successfully improving the model's universality and accuracy. This model has significant improvements compared to the baseline PointNet model.
